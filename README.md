## 🚀 What does it do?

This extension allows you to **use and copy Discord emojis/stickers** without Nitro by unlocking blocked UI behavior. No more grayed-out emojis or Nitro nags.

### ✅ Features:

* Click any emoji or sticker to copy its **direct URL**.
* Automatically detects animated emojis and copies the `.gif` version if available.
* Optional PNG mode for higher quality (`.png` instead of `.webp`).
* Optional larger emoji size (makes them look like stickers).
* Removes Nitro popups and other annoying UI clutter.
* Requires **no Discord token** and **doesn’t connect to the internet** (except to fetch emoji images).
* Fully customizable UI to personalize the extension experience.
* Allows copying **emojis from other users**, even if you don’t have access to them.
* **Fully unlocked emoji and sticker panel**, with no Discord limitations.

## ❓ FAQ

**Does this steal my token?**
🚫 Absolutely not. It doesn't access or send any data to any server. Feel free to inspect the code.

**How does it work?**
🧠 It simply modifies the Discord webpage locally using `content.js`.

**Can I get banned for using this?**
🤷 Probably not. The extension doesn’t send any requests or interfere with Discord servers, so there’s no way for Discord to know you’re using it.

**It have virus?**
No, and you can verify this, opening the code. Is open source and you can modify if you want.
